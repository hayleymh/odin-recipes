        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kugel is a cherished dish in Jewish cuisine, renowned for its comforting and versatile nature. 
            This baked casserole typically features a base of egg noodles or potatoes, bound together with a mixture of eggs, sour cream, and sometimes cottage cheese.
             The flavor profile can range from sweet to savory, with sweet variations often incorporating fruits such as raisins or apples, 
             while savory renditions may include onions or vegetables. Spices like cinnamon or nutmeg add depth to the dish, 
             which is baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet soft and creamy within. Whether served as a side dish or a dessert, 
             kugel embodies the essence of home-cooked comfort food and serves as a centerpiece for festive gatherings and family meals, 
             evoking a sense of tradition and warmth with every bite.</p>
