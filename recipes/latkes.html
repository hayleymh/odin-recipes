        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Latkes, a traditional dish in Jewish cuisine, are savory potato pancakes that hold a special place in holiday celebrations, particularly during Hanukkah. 
            Grated potatoes mixed with onions, eggs, and flour are fried to a golden crisp, resulting in a delightful blend of texturesâ€”crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. 
            Seasoned with salt and pepper, these fried delights are often served with a dollop of applesauce or sour cream, adding a tangy contrast to their rich potato flavor. 
            Latkes symbolize the miracle of Hanukkah, where oil that was only sufficient for one day burned for eight days, 
            making them a delicious reminder of the festival's enduring spirit and traditions.</p>
