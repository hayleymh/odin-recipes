        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Latkes, a traditional dish in Jewish cuisine, are savory potato pancakes that hold a special place in holiday celebrations, particularly during Hanukkah. 
            Grated potatoes mixed with onions, eggs, and flour are fried to a golden crisp, resulting in a delightful blend of textures—crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. 
            Seasoned with salt and pepper, these fried delights are often served with a dollop of applesauce or sour cream, adding a tangy contrast to their rich potato flavor. 
            Latkes symbolize the miracle of Hanukkah, where oil that was only sufficient for one day burned for eight days, 
            making them a delicious reminder of the festival's enduring spirit and traditions.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large Russet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed and cut lengthwise into quarters</li>
            <li>1 large onion (8 ounces), peeled and cut into quarters</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon fine sea salt), plus more for sprinkling</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Safflower or other oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the potatoes and onion. 
                Transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel and squeeze and wring out as much of the liquid as possible.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs, flour, salt, baking powder and pepper, and mix until the flour is absorbed.</li>
            <li>In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in about ¼ inch of the oil. Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in the pan should sizzle), 
                use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan, cooking in batches. Use a spatula to flatten and shape the drops into discs. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, about 5 minutes, flip. 
                Cook until the second side is deeply browned, about another 5 minutes. Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. 
                Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
