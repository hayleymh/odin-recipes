        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Matzo ball soup is a beloved traditional dish in Jewish cuisine, often enjoyed during Passover and year-round. 
            At its heart is the matzo ball, a dumpling made from matzo meal, eggs, water, and fat, typically rendered from chicken. 
            These fluffy orbs are cooked in a flavorful broth, usually chicken, along with vegetables such as carrots, celery, and sometimes onions. 
            The soup is known for its comforting warmth and hearty texture, with the matzo balls soaking up the savory flavors of the broth. 
            It's not only a delicious dish but also holds cultural significance, symbolizing tradition, nourishment, and community gatherings.</p>
